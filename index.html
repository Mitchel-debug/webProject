                During my visit to the Met, I decided to focus on the Blade and Mounting for a Short Sword (Wakizashi). This art piece is part of the "Samurai Splendor: Sword Fittings from Edo Japan" exhibition. According to <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/samurai-splendor">The Metropolitan museum,</a> this type of artwork originated from The Tokugawa regime brought economic growth, prolonged peace, and widespread enjoyment of the arts and culture. The Tokugawa administration wanted to find a way to impose class separation, so they displayed their personal taste in public. Fittings and accessories for their swords, which were an indispensable symbol of power and authority, became a critical means of self-expression and a focal point of artistic creation. This extraordinary exhibition  offers a captivating glimpse into the world of Japanese sword fittings during the Edo period (1603-1868). Hosted at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, this collection of meticulously crafted sword fittings provides a fascinating insight into the artistry, culture, and traditions of the samurai warriors.

        <p>
            I'm obssessed with the markings and the gold-alloy coins used to create decorations for this sheath. According to the Met, this was made during the 16th century. Questions I have would be:
            Since the sheath signified power, what value did those coins hold?

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Brief Overview of the history:</h3>
        <p>
            Samurai's started making swords and decorative sheats in the late 16th century. Around this time, Samurais were no longer fighting battles and wars. They started acquirung lands, and began to govern these properties.
            Before the 16th century, this is how a samurai's sword would look:
        </p>
        <img id="armor" src="images/armor.webp" alt="">
        <p>
            As you can see, the swords weren't that decorative. The designs were more geometric and floral. After the 16th century, when the wars had ended, the samurais weren't really using sword for the sole purpose of killing anymore, so they began to dress more like civilians. They would add picturesque designs to their swords. Samurais would wear dull color clothes so that the color of their swords would stand out. The Edo period was a time of peace and stability in Japan, characterized by the rise of the samurai class and the flourishing of arts and culture. During this period, the samurai's sword was not only a weapon but also a symbol of power, honor, and social status. Samurai warriors adorned their swords with exquisite fittings, including tsuba (sword guards), menuki (hilt ornaments), and kozuka (knife handles), which were meticulously crafted by skilled artisans.

                At the heart of Samurai Splendor lies the unparalleled craftsmanship and technical mastery displayed in each sword fitting. The exhibition showcases a diverse array of fittings, ranging from intricately carved tsuba depicting scenes from nature and mythology to exquisitely detailed menuki featuring animals, warriors, and mythical creatures. One of the highlights of the exhibition is the demonstration of traditional metalworking techniques used by Edo-period artisans. Visitors can witness firsthand the meticulous process of forging, engraving, and finishing each sword fitting, which required years of training and dedication to master. The precision and attention to detail exhibited in these works of art are a testament to the skill and ingenuity of the craftsmen of the time. Beyond their technical brilliance, the sword fittings featured in Samurai Splendor are imbued with rich cultural and symbolic significance. Each piece reflects the aesthetic sensibilities, values, and beliefs of Edo-period Japan, offering valuable insights into the mindset of the samurai warriors.
                For example, many of the tsuba on display are adorned with motifs inspired by nature, such as flowers, birds, and landscapes. These motifs were not merely decorative but held deeper symbolic meanings, representing concepts such as beauty, strength, and resilience. Similarly, the menuki and kozuka often featured auspicious symbols believed to bring good fortune and protection to the wearer.
